### This is the Kevin Powell's Conquering Responsive Layouts's Final Challenge

# Your Final Challenge

## Conquering Responsive Layouts / Day 21 | You've done it!

This challenge reinforces everything we've looked at.

Many parts of it are similar to what we've already seen, but there are a few sections that have some new twists. 
That said, everything in this challenge can be completed with what you've learned so far, 
and if you can make this page responsive, you're rocking it!

A few considerations

I've only provided a desktop version of the design (except for one section). 
Despite this, I want you to take a mobile-first approach.

One of the most common reasons I hear as an excuse for writing desktop-first is that's what the design gives them. 
We've seen why we can still tackle things mobile-first despite that, so let's put it into practice!

The black box around the design is the viewport. 
The content inside should be limited to the max-width given in the design specs, 
but the backgrounds should extend to the edges of the viewport no matter the size.

The PDF outlines 2 specific breakpoints to use. 
You can modify them a little if you feel that it's appropriate, but you should aim for those ballparks.

Have fun with this, and be proud of the progress that you've made!
